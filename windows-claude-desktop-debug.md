# Finding Claude Desktop Logs on Windows

## Method 1: Claude Desktop Developer Tools

1. In Claude Desktop, press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open Developer Tools
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Try the authenticate command again
4. Look for any red error messages or logs starting with "OAuth:"

## Method 2: Claude Desktop Log Files

Windows log locations (check these folders):

```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Claude\logs\
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\.claude\logs\
```

Look for files like:
- `main.log`
- `renderer.log` 
- `mcp.log`
- Files with today's date

## Method 3: Windows Event Viewer

1. Press `Windows + X` and select "Event Viewer"
2. Navigate to: Windows Logs > Application
3. Look for entries from "Claude" or "Electron"

## Method 4: Quick PowerShell Commands

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
# Find Claude log files
Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:APPDATA\Claude" -Recurse -Filter "*.log" | Select-Object FullName

# Or check Local AppData
Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Claude" -Recurse -Filter "*.log" | Select-Object FullName

# Check which process is using port 9741
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9741 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Check ports 9741-9758
9741..9758 | ForEach-Object { 
    $port = $_
    $conn = Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $port -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if ($conn) {
        Write-Host "Port $port is OCCUPIED"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Port $port is AVAILABLE"
    }
}
```

## Method 5: Manual Browser Test

Since we can't run Node scripts, let's do a manual test:

1. First, check what's using the ports. In Command Prompt:
   ```cmd
   netstat -ano | findstr :9741
   ```

2. Open this URL directly in your browser (replace PORT with 9741 or the first free port):
   ```
   https://appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2?response_type=code&client_id=ABRlxZcZnmwYNGFoi1MopMid2ac7sgAm6UNN8D46dxQb5yKch8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2F127-0-0-1.sslip.io%3A9741%2Fcb&scope=com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting&state=manual-test
   ```

3. Tell us:
   - Does it show the QuickBooks login page?
   - Or does it immediately show the "scope parameter missing" error?
   - What's the exact URL in the browser when you see the error?

## What We're Looking For

When you find the logs, look for these patterns:

1. **Port mismatch**:
   ```
   OAuth: Listener started on port 9742
   OAuth: CRITICAL - Listener port: 9742, Redirect URI: https://127-0-0-1.sslip.io:9741/cb
   ```
   (Notice different ports)

2. **Missing scope**:
   ```
   OAuth: URL Components:
     - scope: null
   ```

3. **OAuth client issues**:
   ```
   TokenManager.generateAuthUrl: WARNING - OAuthClient.scopes.Accounting not available
   ```

## Quick Things to Check

1. **Is Windows Defender blocking the callback?**
   - Check Windows Security > Firewall & network protection
   - Look for blocked connection attempts

2. **Corporate firewall/proxy?**
   - Are you on a corporate network that might block certain ports?

3. **Which browser opens?**
   - Edge? Chrome? Firefox?
   - Some browsers have stricter security policies

Please share whatever logs you can find, especially:
- The exact error message/page you see
- The URL in the browser when you get the error
- Any logs from Claude Desktop's developer console
